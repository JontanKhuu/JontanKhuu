Hello, I am a student currently studying at the University at Buffalo. I am pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Science. 
I aim to further my knowledge in this field as well as completing goals I've set for myself, the first of which is to 
get a better grasp of coding as well as working in a professional environment.
